- Track the journey of products from farm to table.
- Verify organic and fair-trade certifications.
- Ensure data integrity and authenticity.

## Tech Stack
- **Rust**
- **TypeScript**
- **Anchor**
- **Solana**

  ## Tools
 - **Solana Playground IDE**: Used for initial development and testing of Solana programs. It provides an easy-to-use interface to write, deploy, and test Solana smart contracts without needing extensive local setup.(This project was 100% developed in solana playground ide) 
- **VSCode**: Used for advanced development and editing. VSCode provides powerful extensions for Rust, TypeScript, and Solana development, allowing for a more integrated and efficient coding environment.
