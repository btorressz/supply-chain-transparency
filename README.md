# supply-chain-transparency

A Solana-based program for tracking the journey of agricultural products from farm to table, ensuring transparency and authenticity of organic and fair-trade certifications.

This project is currently under active development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!



This project implements a Solana program using Anchor to provide supply chain transparency for agricultural products. The program allows users to:
- Track the journey of products from farm to table.
- Verify organic and fair-trade certifications.
- Ensure data integrity and authenticity.

## Tech Stack
- **Rust**
- **TypeScript**
- **Anchor**
- **Solana**

  ## Tools
 - **Solana Playground IDE**: Used for initial development and testing of Solana programs. It provides an easy-to-use interface to write, deploy, and test Solana smart contracts without needing extensive local setup.(This project was 100% developed in solana playground ide) 
- **VSCode**: Used for advanced development and editing. VSCode provides powerful extensions for Rust, TypeScript, and Solana development, allowing for a more integrated and efficient coding environment.

## Future Ideas

Here are some potential enhancements and features that can be added to the Supply Chain Transparency project to further improve its functionality and value:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Implement more granular roles such as producer, distributor, retailer, and consumer, each with specific permissions.
   - Extend the `UserRole` enum to include these roles and add logic to handle role-specific actions.

2. **Advanced Data Analytics**:
   - Add functionality to analyze and visualize the data stored on the blockchain, such as tracking the average time products spend at each stage, detecting anomalies, and providing insights into supply chain efficiency.

3. **Automated Notifications**:
   - Implement a system to send automated notifications to users when specific events occur (e.g., when a product moves to a new stage, when a new certification is added, or when a product reaches the consumer).
   - 4. **Smart Contracts for Payments**:
   - Implement smart contracts to handle payments at different stages of the supply chain. For example, automatic payment release when a product reaches a certain stage or is certified.
